		<h2> Use Case Dylan "Captain"</h2>

With this new software he can easily make notes and adjustments to the applicants while keeping track of there progress in the pre work stage. </p>
		<p> After submitting my application I go down to CNM to make a payment to begin the process of bettering my life. After making my payment in cash from selling a kidney.  I quickly receive  an email as a notification.</p>
		<p> Dylan logs back into the AAAA program to see if I and or any other applicants  have started there pre-work.  He sees that I have made my payment and started to  1. created my CNM and Deep Dive student accounts 2. set up the toolset and need to get my book so I can self-study.</p>
		<p> Since the installment of the new program, Dylan now has spare time to dress Captain Arlo up as a Klingon and reenact  scenes from the bridge of Star Trek V since there can be only one Captain on the bridgeß.</p>
